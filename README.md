# DailyCommit 🚀

**DailyCommit** is a minimal, offline-first web app that helps developers build a **daily coding habit** by tracking consistency instead of competition.

No accounts.  
No pressure.  
Just commit every day.


## ✨ Features

- 📆 **Daily coding streak tracking**
- 🔥 **Current streak & best streak**
- 🧠 **Focus on consistency, not productivity**
- 💾 **Offline-first (localStorage only)**
- 📸 **One-click snapshot download (JPG)**
- 🌙 **Dark, Apple-inspired UI**
- ⏱️ **Timezone-safe daily reset**
- ⚡ **No login · No tracking**


## 🧠 Why DailyCommit is Different

Unlike task managers or habit trackers, **DailyCommit is opinionated**:

- ❌ No to-do lists  
- ❌ No reminders  
- ❌ No goals pressure  

Instead, it answers one simple question:

> *“Did I code today?”*

Even **1 question counts**.
