    Commit to coding, every day.

  <!-- Big idea -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Code every day. That’s it.</h2>
    <p>
      DailyCommit is built around one simple idea:
      if you show up every day and code something,
      you will improve over time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Problem -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>The problem with most productivity apps</h2>
    <p>
      Most tools try to do too much.
      Tasks, reminders, goals, notifications —
      and eventually, burnout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developers don’t need more complexity.
      They need consistency.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- What -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What is DailyCommit?</h2>
    <p>
      DailyCommit is a simple tool for developers who want to code regularly.
      It lets you log how many questions you solved today and shows your
      progress using a clean streak calendar.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- How -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You code something today</li>
      <li>You enter how many questions you solved</li>
      <li>Your streak and heatmap update instantly</li>
      <li>Miss a day? The streak breaks — honestly</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Why -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Why DailyCommit?</h2>
    <p>
      Many developers start strong but lose consistency.
      DailyCommit focuses on showing up every day,
      not competing with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even solving one question counts.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Closing -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Small habit. Big long-term results.</h2>
    <p>
      You don’t need to code for hours.
      You just need to not break the chain.
    </p>
